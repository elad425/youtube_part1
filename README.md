# YouTube App

To run our code:
1. install android studio
2. clone the repository
3. connect your android device
4. click run and open the app
5. allow all the permission
6. enjoy.

workflow:
we first divided the required pages between us, one did the sign up/login pages,  while the other did the home page/video upload/video watch pages (we switched the pages for the web part)
each one designed his pages to look as close as possible to the real youtube
we then added logic to check the users sign up information, and login info, added the ability to add videos,comments and edit/delete those, navigate between pages, like and dislike videos, and subscribe to favorite channels, and finally we gave the users the option to search for videos and switch between horizontal and vertical oriantation. 

**important Note:**  this app doesnt support accsess to images and videos from google photos, so only use the default gallery app.

## Permissions
The app requires the following permissions:

1. READ_MEDIA_VIDEO
2. READ_MEDIA_IMAGES
3. READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

These permissions are requested at runtime. If the permissions are not granted, the app will close. Each time the app is activated, it checks for these permissions and requests them if they are not already granted.

**this app is not complete stay tuned for the next update:)**
